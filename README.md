# Password Protect .zip Files
*The solution*

```
zip -re output-file.zip folder-name
```


## Zip A Folder
**Open the Terminal** with the directory set to the *parent folder* of the folder needing to be zipped

```
zip -r output-file.zip folder-name
```
👉 Note: **Always** include `-r`. It means *recursively* include all files and sub folders. 

*output-file.zip = name of the .zip file created.*
 
 *folder-name = target folder name to zip.*


## Zip A Folder + Password
**Open the Terminal** with the directory set to the *parent folder* of the folder needing to be zipped

```
zip -r -e output-file.zip folder-name
```
👉 Note: **Always** include `-e`. It means *encrypt* which sets the password

Enter the password and press enter.
You will be prompted to re-enter your password and press enter. 


## Merge -r With -e
**Open the Terminal** with the directory set to the *parent folder* of the folder needing to be zipped

```
zip -re output-file.zip folder-name
```
🥳 It works! 


## Why Is This Useful?
1. Macbooks are missing this functionality to easily add a password to your .zip files.
2. Developers should think about security on a daily basis. 😎🔐
3. Most professionals are able to use the basics of the Terminal.
